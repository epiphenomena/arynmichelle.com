### Initial prompt

We're going to build a website for a female singer/songwriter who uses the
stagename Aryn Michelle.


The site's architecture is going to be based on combining html fragments using the javascript library HTMX.
There will be one or more "root" pages, that define the basic layout, and load HTMX, other javascript and css.
And then there will be html fragments that are pulled in by the HTMX often "onload" and either based on a
given url or based upon a query parameter. The idea is to be able to define a base layout template and then be
able to edit / load the content separately without requiring a compilation step.

Imagine you are a highly creative and experienced digital architect and brand storyteller. Your task is not just to design a website, but to
build a living, breathing digital experience. You specialize in translating abstract concepts and emotions into tangible, interactive web environments. You have a deep understanding of user psychology, aesthetic principles, and the art of crafting a compelling narrative through visual and functional design. Your goal is to create a website that doesn't just display information, but that immerses the user in a world and makes them feel something profound. You are responsible for conceptualizing the entire user journey, from the first click to the final interaction, ensuring every element is intentional and contributes to the overall story.

The ultimate goal is to build a landing page for a musician who goes by the stage name Aryn Michelle. Start by creating a detailed description of the design and design elements. The design should be mobile first and emphasize eye catching transitions especially for mobile users. The landing page should be clean, modern, engaging. It should be beautiful on mobile and desktop. It should feature links to several social media and music sites. It should have defined ui elements for highlighting upcoming events and recently released songs / albums with cover art, descriptions and links to sites like spotify to listen. The design description should be detailed -- describing all of the design elements clearly so that it is easy to translate into html and css.

Of course. As a digital architect and brand storyteller, I see a website not as a page, but as a space—an environment where a story unfolds. For Aryn Michelle, we will not simply build a landing page; we will construct a *Digital Prelude*. The core concept is **"Sonic Architecture,"** where music is a tangible, explorable structure. The user's journey is one of discovery, moving through rooms of sound and story, guided by light and motion.

The design is conceived mobile-first, ensuring the most intimate and tactile experience is flawless. Every transition is a beat, every scroll a measure.

### **Project: Aryn Michelle - The Digital Prelude**

#### **I. Core Philosophy & Guiding Principles**

* **Narrative:** The Unveiling of Sound. The user arrives in a space of quiet potential and, through interaction, unveils the layers of Aryn's music and identity.
* **Emotion:** Intrigue, Intimacy, Wonder. The experience should feel personal, like discovering a hidden gem or a secret world.
* **Aesthetic:** Ethereal Minimalism. Clean, spacious, and modern, but with depth and texture provided by light, shadow, and fluid motion. It’s less about decoration and more about creating atmosphere.

#### **II. The Design Elements: A Detailed Breakdown**

**1. Color Palette: Night & Nebula**

* **Primary Background (`--color-background`):** A deep, near-black charcoal, not pure black. `#121215`. This creates a sense of depth and makes light-based elements pop.
* **Primary Text (`--color-text`):** A soft, off-white. `#EAEAEA`. Easy on the eyes, providing clear readability without harsh contrast.
* **Primary Accent (`--color-accent-primary`):** "Digital Amethyst". A vibrant, luminous purple. `#9D72FF`. Used for key interactive elements, calls-to-action, and subtle glows. It represents creativity and mystique.
* **Secondary Accent (`--color-accent-secondary`):** "Sonic Gold". A muted, warm gold. `#D4AF37`. Used for secondary links, highlights, and to add a touch of classic elegance.

**2. Typography: Modern Clarity & Lyrical Soul**

* **Headings (`font-family: 'Syne', sans-serif;`):** A modern, geometric sans-serif font. It’s clean, architectural, and bold. Used for section titles and Aryn's name. (Weight: 700 for main titles, 500 for sub-headings).
* **Body & Paragraphs (`font-family: 'Lora', serif;`):** A contemporary serif with a lyrical quality. It's highly readable and brings a human, storyteller's touch to descriptions and bio text. (Weight: 400).
* **UI Elements (`font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;`):** A neutral, highly legible sans-serif for buttons, dates, and labels. Ensures clarity and function. (Weight: 500).

**3. Global UI & Interactive Elements**

* **Navigation (Mobile):** A minimalist "hamburger" icon (three horizontal lines in the primary accent color). On tap, it triggers a full-screen overlay menu. The menu background is the primary charcoal, with links (`Music`, `Tour`, `About`, `Connect`) rendered in the bold heading font. The transition is a fluid, mask-like reveal from the icon's position.
* **Navigation (Desktop):** A sticky header appears after the user scrolls past the initial hero section. It's a semi-transparent dark bar containing Aryn's name on the left and navigation links on the right, with a subtle underline in the secondary accent color on hover.
* **Buttons:**
    * **Primary CTA:** Solid background of `Digital Amethyst`, text in `off-white`. On hover/tap, it "glows" with a `box-shadow` of the same color and scales up slightly (`transform: scale(1.05);`).
    * **Secondary CTA:** A "ghost button" style. A 1px border of `Sonic Gold`, text in `Sonic Gold`. On hover/tap, the background fills with the gold color and the text becomes the primary background charcoal.
* **Scroll Indicator:** In the hero section, a single, thin vertical line with a pulsating dot at the bottom, encouraging the user to scroll.

### **III. The User Journey: Section by Section**

This is the architectural plan for the landing page, from top to bottom.

#### **Section 1: The Overture (Hero Section)**

* **Visual:** The entire viewport is the dark charcoal background. In the center is a **dynamic, generative art piece**—a softly glowing orb of particles in the `Digital Amethyst` color.
    * **On Desktop:** The particle orb subtly reacts to the user's mouse movement, creating gentle ripples and trails of light.
    * **On Mobile:** The orb pulses slowly, like a heartbeat. A very subtle parallax effect responds to the phone's gyroscope, giving it a sense of 3D depth.
* **Text:** Overlaid on this visual is the name **"ARYN MICHELLE"** in the large, clean heading font, rendered in soft white. Below it, a single, evocative tagline like "Architect of Sound & Story."
* **Transition:** As the user scrolls down, the central orb of light gracefully dissolves, its particles flowing down the screen to seamlessly transition into the title of the next section. This is the most crucial, eye-catching transition.

#### **Section 2: The Discography (Recent Releases)**

* **Layout:** A horizontally scrolling section. On mobile, it's a swipe-able carousel that feels tactile and engaging. On desktop, it's a clean carousel with subtle arrow navigation.
* **Section Title:** "Latest Works," animated to fade and slide in from the left as the section becomes visible.
* **UI Element: The Release Card**
    * **Container:** A rectangular card with slightly rounded corners. It has no background color initially, making the cover art appear to float. On hover/tap, a soft `Digital Amethyst` glow appears around the edges.
    * **Cover Art:** The dominant element of the card. A high-resolution image of the album or single cover.
    * **Card Body (below the art):**
        * **Title:** Name of the song/album in the heading font (e.g., "The Real Thing").
        * **Type:** A small label in the UI font (e.g., "ALBUM" or "SINGLE").
        * **Description:** 1-2 sentences of evocative text in the body serif font.
        * **Listen Links:** A row of clean, minimalist icons for Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc. The icons are `off-white` and change to `Digital Amethyst` on hover/tap.
* **Animation:** As the user scrolls this section into view, each card animates in with a staggered "fade and scale up" effect.

#### **Section 3: On The Horizon (Upcoming Events)**

* **Layout:** A clean, vertical list against the charcoal background. A thin, glowing vertical line (`Sonic Gold`, 1px wide) runs down the left side, acting as a timeline.
* **Section Title:** "On The Horizon," animated in a similar fashion.
* **UI Element: The Event Item**
    * **Container:** A `flexbox` row.
    * **Date Block (Left):** A block containing the month (e.g., "OCT") and day (e.g., "23"). The month is in the UI font, and the large day number is in the heading font. A dot on the timeline line corresponds to this item's position.
    * **Details Block (Right):**
        * **Venue Name:** In the heading font, `off-white`.
        * **City, State:** In the body serif font, slightly smaller and dimmer.
        * **Tickets Button:** The secondary "ghost button" style with `Sonic Gold` border and text.
* **Animation:** Each event item fades and slides in from the right as the user scrolls down the list.

#### **Section 4: The Connection (Social Media Links)**

* **Layout:** A simple, centered section designed for a final, clear call to action.
* **Section Title:** "Join the Story"
* **UI Element: Social Icon Grid**
    * A grid of large, beautifully simple icons for her primary platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, etc.).
    * The icons are rendered in `off-white`.
    * **Interaction:** On hover/tap, the icon scales up (`transform: scale(1.1);`) and transitions its color to `Digital Amethyst`. This micro-interaction is highly satisfying on mobile.
* **Email Signup:** A clean, single-line input field for an email address with a primary CTA button that says "Subscribe."

#### **Footer**

* **Layout:** Minimalist and clean. A single line with `© 2025 Aryn Michelle.` on the left, and maybe a "Site by..." credit on the right. All text is small and in a dimmer `off-white` (`#888888`).
